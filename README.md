# Available models for Adblock Radio
List of available radios for [Adblock Radio commercials detector](https://www.adblockradio.com/).

**Important note: the web player at [https://www.adblockradio.com/player](adblockradio.com/player) is a demo that features only a subset of all available radios. To listen to other radios, you need to run [the standalone player](https://github.com/adblockradio/buffer-player).**

## I want to suggest another radio or podcast
Great! Please understand that more radios means more work needed to support them.

Your are welcome to suggest another radio or podcast, but in return you are expected to help maintaining the filters by classifying mispredictions through an administration UI.

To get started, [search in the *Issues* tab](https://github.com/adblockradio/available-models/issues) to check that the radio you want to add is not already there.
* If it is there, feel free to *thumb up* the first message as a sign of support and/or write a message to indicate that you are willing to help.
* If it is not there, search for it on [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/). [Create an issue](https://github.com/adblockradio/available-models/issues/new/choose) containing the exact **Country** and **Name** of the radio station. From there, we will decide how to proceed.

The framework you will use to help is not ready yet, but will be soon (a matter of weeks at most). This page will be updated accordingly.
